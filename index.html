        <h2>luxury cars</h2>
        <p>
            A luxury car is a car that provides above-average to high-end levels of comfort, features, and equipment. Often, more expensive materials and surface finishes are used, and buyers expect better build quality. The usually higher pricing and more upscale appearance are often associated with the users' higher social status compared to low- and mid-market segment cars.

            The term is relative and partially subjective, reflecting both objective qualities of a car, as well as the projected and perceived image of the vehicle marque.[1] Luxury brands rank above premium brands, though there is no clear distinction between the two.

        </p>
        <p>Traditionally, most luxury cars were large vehicles, though smaller sports-oriented models were produced. "Compact" luxury vehicles such as hatchbacks and off-road capable sport utility vehicles are more recent expansions of luxury qualities in various cars.

            Luxury cars have traditionally emphasized higher levels of comfort and safety.Manufacturers often introduce new safety technologies and comfort amenities on luxury models before they are available on more affordable models. Some brands, like Audi and BMW have expanded their marketing by "introducing lesser priced and strip-down economy versions of their products."

            Luxury vehicles can be a status symbol for conspicuous consumption. However, since many European luxury car buyers shy away from conspicuous consumption, brands offer buyers the option of removing exterior badges that identify the model name or engine size.

            The suspension system of most luxury cars is tuned to prioritize ride quality over handling, however, some are marketed as "sports luxury" and have a greater emphasis on handling characteristics.
